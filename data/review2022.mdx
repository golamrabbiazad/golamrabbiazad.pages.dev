It was a year after the post been publishing.

So, the year 2022 was starting before I moved to Dhaka in <b>Nov 10, 2021</b> to continue my Undergraduate program.
From then I was building my portfolio webiste project. When I'm at the half of my project I exactly remember <b>Nov 23, 2021</b> stolen my macbook pro early 2015 which my father brought for my undergraduate program.
Later I have managed a PC to continue my journey.

In December 13, 2021 published my first version of my portfolio webiste project which is forked <a href="https://leerob.io/">leerob.io</a>. yay ü•≥ üéâ

I have done a tour in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khulna">Khulna, Bangladesh</a> at the end of January, 2022. I have stored the tour photos on my <a href="https://instagram.com/golamrabbiazad">instagram</a> account.

I did a contract based job <b>(1 month)</b>. My role was Data Annotator which I have to complete 5 buckets (buckets contains 10 to 20 images, JSON files) per day that I have to check and fix the error and create JSON file & sync with images.

I got remote work offer in April 2022 from LinkedIn. This was my first remote job, and I don't know about how remote job works, how to handle clients, commitments about project and sync project-client-project. I was to update about the project everyday end of work.

30 hours per week as a <b>Core Developer</b> for building enterpise product.

- I got the job by submitting 3 as exercize projects(A React, Node.js, and vanilla projects).
- My task was to create drag & drop feature by extending <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/draggable">shopify draggable </a> API.
- I did setup, configurations and working basic drag & drop feature, more to work to reach the project vision. <b>(give up)</b>

Project vision: (explaining soon)

<b>I left the job.</b>

I have completed 3 years of undergraduate program in September, 2022. üèÜ

I'm expanding my linkedin networks. Currently, 110+ people connected with me. Please, if you want to <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/golamrabbiazad">join my network</a>
